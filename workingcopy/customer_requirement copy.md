# Customer Infrastructure Requirements

## Business Overview
We need a secure, scalable AWS infrastructure for a document processing application. The system should handle document uploads, processing, storage, and metadata management.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Infrastructure
- **VPC Setup**: Need a Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for high availability
- **EC2 Instances**: Two EC2 instances for document processing in private subnets
- **S3 Storage**: Secure S3 bucket for document storage with encryption
- **Database**: RDS instance for storing document metadata (ID, timestamp, S3 link)
- **Lambda Function**: Serverless function to automate file processing and database updates

### Security Requirements
- All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- IAM roles and policies for least privilege access
- Security groups and Network ACLs for network security
- CloudTrail for audit logging
- CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting

### Performance & Scalability
- Auto-scaling for EC2 instances based on load
- Cost optimization to stay within $200/month budget
- Modular design for easy scaling
- High availability across multiple AZs

### FinOps & Cost Optimization Requirements
- **Right-sizing**: Optimize EC2 instance types, RDS instance classes, and Lambda memory allocation
- **Cost Allocation**: Implement comprehensive tagging strategy for cost tracking
- **Budget Management**: Set up AWS Budgets with alerts at 80% and 100% of monthly budget
- **Reserved Instances**: Recommend appropriate RI/Savings Plans for predictable workloads
- **Storage Optimization**: Implement S3 lifecycle policies and EBS optimization
- **Network Cost Optimization**: Minimize data transfer costs and NAT Gateway usage
- **Cost Monitoring**: Set up detailed cost monitoring with CloudWatch and Cost Explorer
- **Resource Scheduling**: Implement start/stop schedules for non-production resources

### Compliance & Monitoring
- Automated backups for RDS
- Lifecycle policies for S3 data management
- SNS notifications for critical alerts
- Performance testing and monitoring
- Cost governance and reporting

## Timeline
- Project completion within 2 weeks
- Client training sessions required
- Comprehensive documentation needed

## Budget
- Maximum monthly cost: $200
- Focus on cost-effective solutions
- Use reserved instances where beneficial
- Implement FinOps best practices for ongoing cost optimization

## FinOps Deliverables
- Monthly cost breakdown and estimates
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Resource right-sizing analysis
- Tagging strategy for cost allocation
- Budget monitoring and alerting setup
- Reserved Instance/Savings Plan recommendations

Technical Deliverables:
    - Detailed Architecture Design Document and High-level AWS architecture diagram
    - Infrastructure Planning Document
    - Terraform scripts with proper modules, dependencies, variables, and outputs
